https://pacific-anchorage-71196.herokuapp.com/

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

## Functionality üí™
#### Here's how the app works: 
1. Welcome to Bobs Burgers! üòã

    1.1 In the 'Ready to Eat' box on the left side of the page is a list of burgers waiting to be eaten. When the user clicks 'Eat me', the burger will move to the 'Already Eaten' box on the right side of the page.

    1.2 This app stores all burgers in a database and can be deleted using the delete button next to the burgers in the 'Already Eaten' box.

    1.3 At the bottom of the page is an input box where the user can type in a burger of their choice. Once they hit submit, their burger will be moved into the 'Ready to Eat' box on the left side of the page. 

## Getting Started üèÅ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for grading and testing purposes. 

1. Clone repository. Click on the clone button next to the repository (clone with SSH). 
2. Open Terminal and git clone (paste) into directory of your choice. 
3. Open folder in VS Code. 
4. Inside of the data directory is the `friends.js` file containing the list of ideal matches already stored in the database. 
5. The public directory contains assets, with the html files, the CSS directory with the stylesheet, the images and `app.js` which contains the logic for the submit button on the main page, checks validity of form, and controls the modal.
6. Inside of the routing directory holds the `htmlRoutes` which controls the path to each html page from the browswer. The `apiRoutes` contains the logic for the compatibility check and pushes the results.
7. `server.js` configures the app, requires the dependencies and starts listening on the PORT indicated.
